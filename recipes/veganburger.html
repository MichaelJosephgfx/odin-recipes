            <!--INSTRUCTIONS-->
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a skillet and saute the onion and garlic with a tiny bit of salt <br>
                    (no oil) for a few minutes until translucent but not brown.</li>
                <li>Add the carrots, cayenne, and cumin and cook a couple minutes <br>
                    or until carrot is tender. Turn off the heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>Mash the beans in a large bowl. Add the carrot mixture, mustard, <br>
                    ketchup, tamari and oats.</li>
                <li>Mix well, then shape the mixture into eight patties. <br>
                    You can make more, smaller patties, or fewer, larger ones. <br>
                    For the grill shape the patties thicker.</li>
                <li>Heat a nonstick or cast-iron skillet and coat with cooking spray. <br>
                     Cook patties over medium heat for four to five minutes on each side, <br>
                     or until golden brown. I like mine a little charred for extra <br>
                      flavor or you can char them on the grill.</li>
            </ol>
