                <li>2 eggplants (like Japanese or Chinese eggplants, cut into ¾ cm-thick rings)</li>
                <li>1 cup mint leaves</li>
                <li>1.5 tabelspoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>4 cloves</li>
                <li>4 green cardamom pods</li>
                <li>1-inch stick cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon coriander seeds</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cayenne</li>
                <li>2 medium tomatoes, diced</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, sliced</li>

            </ul>

            <!--INSTRUCTIONS-->
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Toss the eggplants with ½ tablespoon oil and a pinch of salt and arrange in a single <br>
                    layer on a non-stick rack (you can use a baking sheet, <br>
                    but a rack is more effective in preventing the eggplant from sticking)</li>
                <li>Broil on high in the oven for between-10 minutes or until the eggplant <br>
                        is lightly browned and almost tender</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat half of the 1 tablespoon of oil and saute the coriander, <br>
                    cloves, cinnamon and cardamom for about 2-3 minutes until fragrant. <br> 
                    Drain and remove from the pan to a blender.</li>
                <li>In the same skillet, saute the onions and garlic until browned on the edges. 
                    Add this to the blender.</li>
                <li>Add the tomatoes to the skillet and toss for a couple of minutes until they <br>
                    begin to soften. Add to the blender along with the mint leaves. <br>
                    Add the turmeric, cayenne and jaggery to the blender as well.</li>
                <li>Blend the ingredients, adding a little water, until they make a fairly smooth paste.</li>
                <li>Cut the grilled eggplant rings into quarters</li>
                <li>Heat the remaining oil in the skillet.</li>
                <li>Add the ground masala and stir for a few minutes. <br>
                    Then add the eggplant. Simmer together on low heat, about 10 minutes, <br>
                    adding some water if necessary to keep the sauce slightly fluid. Add the jaggery.</li>
                <li>Add salt to taste. Garnish with coriander if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with chapatis or rotis.</li>
                        
            </ol>
