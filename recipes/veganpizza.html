                <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
               </ul>

               <h3>Toppings</h3>
               <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup marinara sauce</li>
                <li>homemade vegan mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>1/2 cup fresh basil</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
               </ul>

               <h2>Instructions</h2>
               <h3>Pizza Dough</h3>
               <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees F.  (yup, as hot as it goes).</li>
                <li>Stir yeast and Â½ tablespoon sugar into warmed water until dissolved. 
                    Let it sit for 7-10 minutes, until foamy. </li>
                <li>In a large bowl, add the flour, garlic powder, salt and remaining sugar. 
                    Whisk to combine. <br> Add the activated yeast to the bowl along with the olive oil. 
                    Mix until all ingredients are well combined and form a dough.<br> 
                    If dough is too sticky, add a couple tablespoons of flour. </li>
                <li>Form the dough into a ball and place back in the bowl 
                    (*lightly dust bowl with flour before placing the dough ball in). <br>
                    Completely cover the bowl with a damp napkin or hand towel for 30 minutes 
                    or until dough doubles in size.</li>
                <li>*You'll need a pizza pan or large cutting board ready to transfer 
                    the pizza into and out of the oven, but you won't be cooking on it. <br> 
                    The pizza will be cooked on parchment paper only.</li>
                <li>Place a large piece of parchment paper over your work area 
                    (about the size of your pan). <br> Dust the paper with flour so you 
                    can spread your dough easily. * Cut the dough in half using a wet knife. <br> 
                    This recipe makes two 10-inch pizzas. I make one pizza at a time. 
                    While one is cooking, I'll prepare the other. </li>
                <li>Using your hands, spread dough across the parchment paper into a 
                    round pizza shape to your desired thickness. <br>
                    I spread the dough pretty thin because it rises while cooking. 
                    The edges should be slightly thicker to form a pillowed crust.</li>
                <li>To season your crust, lightly brush with olive oil and sprinkle 
                    with salt and Italian herbs.</li>
                <li>Using a spoon, spread the sauce evenly over the pizza and 
                    top with the mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Carefully slide the parchment paper onto your pan to transfer to the oven. 
                    Now slide the parchment paper <br> back off your pan and directly onto the middle oven rack. </li>
                <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes, until the crust is golden brown. 
                    The pizza cooks fast so keep an eye on it. </li>
               </ol>

                <li>If the yeast doesn't foam up after 7 - 10 minutes, start <br>

                    or it won't work.</li>
